### Group

This project will be carried out by Anna Esteve Gallifa and Biel Altimira Tarter, both enrolled in group 12.



### Dataset

The chosen dataset is [**SUPPORT2**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/880/support2), obtained from **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The original source of the data is the **Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics**, which was made publicly available in 2023.



### About

The dataset provides 9105 instances representing critically ill patients from 5 US medical centers. Each instance concerns a patient suffering from one or more of 9 categorized diseases. The 42 features, regarding each row, provide information about the patient's psychological state, disease severity and demographics. 



No prior data processing has been performed to the dataset, nor any cleanup of null values. The features have categorical, real, integer and binary types.



### Goal

Our goal will be to use the data to perform a classification task. It is of the upmost importance to assess critically ill patients to prevent painful and prolonged dying processes. Therefore, the gathered data should provide means to determine, based on their health status, the patients' survival rates from two to six months sight.
